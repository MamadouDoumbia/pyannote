PyAnnote
========

``PyAnnote`` is a Python module for collaborative annotation of multimedia content. 

It provides a (hopefully) easy-to-use Python API to store and manipulate temporal annotations of multimedia content. Applications that can benefit from ``PyAnnote`` include video shot (or scene) boundary detection, speaker diarization, audio indexing based on automatic speech transcription or audio/visual person recognition, etc.

Various evaluation metrics are implemented, for the most common automatic audio/video processing tasks such as temporal segmentation, speech activity detection, speaker diarization and identification, etc.

A limited set of automatic annotation algorithms are available for now, that should be increased as ``PyAnnote`` evolve in the future.
