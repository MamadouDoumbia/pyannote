    """One-to-one label mapping based on the Hungarian algorithm

    The `Hungarian` mapper relies on the Hungarian algorithm [1]_ to find the
    one-to-one mapping M between labels of two annotations `A` and `B` that
    maximizes âˆ‘ K(a, M(a)) where `cost` function K(a, b) typically is the
    cooccurrence duration of labels a and b.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost : func
        This parameter controls how K is computed.
        Defaults to :class:`pyannote.base.matrix.get_cooccurrence_matrix`,
        i.e. total cooccurence duration

    Examples
    --------

        >>> from pyannote import Segment, Annotation

        >>> A = Annotation(modality='A')
        >>> A[Segment(0, 4)] = 'a1'
        >>> A[Segment(4, 15)] = 'a2'
        >>> A[Segment(15, 17)] = 'a3'
        >>> A[Segment(17, 25)] = 'a1'
        >>> A[Segment(23, 30)] = 'a2'

        >>> B = Annotation(modality='B')
        >>> B[Segment(0, 10)] = 'b1'
        >>> B[Segment(10, 15)] = 'b2'
        >>> B[Segment(14, 20)] = 'b1'
        >>> B[Segment(23, 30)] = 'b2'

        >>> mapper = HungarianMapper()
        >>> mapping = mapper(A, B)
        >>> print mapping
        (
           a1 <--> b1
           a2 <--> b2
           a3 <-->
        )
