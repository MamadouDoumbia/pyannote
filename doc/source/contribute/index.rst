==========

The latest development source code is hosted on `GitHub <http://github.com/hbredin/pyannote>`_::

	$ git clone git://github.com/hbredin/pyannote

The *master* branch should only contain official ``PyAnnote`` releases, tagged with the version number. 

The *development* branch is where you will find (possibly broken) cutting-edge code.

You can use GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/hbredin/pyannote/issues>`_ to report a bug.

Here is the best way to contribute some code:

	- fork PyAnnote on `GitHub <http://github.com/hbredin/pyannote>`_,
	- commit and push your changes,
	- send me a pull request.
